# What is the difference between `display: inline` and `display: inline-block`?

Inline elements:
* respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom
* cannot have a width and height set
* allow other elements to sit to their left and right.

Block elements:
* respect all of those
* force a line break after the block element

Inline-block elements:
* allow other elements to sit to their left and right
* respect top & bottom margins and padding
* respect height and width
